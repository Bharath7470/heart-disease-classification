# Heart Disease Classification using Decision Tree & Random Forest

This project uses the heart disease dataset to build and compare tree-based models.

## ✅ What’s included:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Tree visualization with `plot_tree`
- Feature importance plot
- Accuracy comparison and cross-validation

## 📁 Files
- `heart_tree_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used (if uploaded)

## 📊 Tools used
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (DecisionTree, RandomForest, cross_val_score)

## 🔍 Output
- Best accuracy using Random Forest
- Important features identified: `cp`, `thalach`, `exang`, etc.
